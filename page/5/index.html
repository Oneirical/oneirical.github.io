            <p>Being a part of the technology community means developing relationships with wizards thousands of kilometres away. It is a simultaneously lonely and connected feeling.</p>
<p>And then, sometimes, all those threads converge in a single point. One becomes able to look in the eye and smile at all those distant mentors, friends and co-collaborators we shared our work with.</p>
<p>That place, for me, today, is RustConf.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to tomorrow, another full day of learning and sharing. But for the souls who couldn't make it, here is a diary of the day's experiences - and, for those who <em>did</em> make it, well, a different perspective from their own may be appreciated.</p>
<h1 id="artificial-incompetence">Artificial Incompetence</h1>
<p>No, to Hell with &quot;chronological order&quot;. This is the penultimate talk I listened to today, about the crate <a href="https://mutants.rs/"><code>cargo-mutants</code></a>. I'm bringing it up first because I thought the technology was really cool. Plus, it's something readers of the blog can probably play with right now!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">This is not a new concept.</a> However, this Rust-specific implementation matches harmoniously with the language's robustness.</p>
<p>Running <code>cargo mutants</code> in your command line will immediately summon an imaginary software developer intern who will proceed to butcher your testing suite code and implement horrible bugs. This is expressed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing operators (such as <code>&amp;&amp;</code> with <code>||</code>, or <code>+=</code> with <code>-=</code>)</li>
<li>Replacing functions with a return type with an arbitrary variation of that return type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of the latter: <code>get_cute_otters()</code> returns a <code>-&gt; Option&lt;usize&gt;</code>. <code>cargo-mutants</code> will transform calls of this function like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="diff" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-diff "><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"><span style="color:#a1000d;">- assert_eq!(get_cute_otters(), Some(3));
</span><span style="color:#558f1f;">+ assert_eq!(Some(0), Some(3));
</span><span style="color:#558f1f;">+ // or
</span><span style="color:#558f1f;">+ assert_eq!(None, Some(3));
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>cargo-mutants</code> will then raise a warning for any mutation attempt that did not break tests and cause them to fail. After all, if randomly slamming the keyboard on your test suite is labeled as &quot;perfectly fine&quot; by <code>cargo test</code>, it may be time for some detective work.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this does not seem like <code>cargo clippy</code> where one should aim for absolutely 0 warnings. After all, replacing <code>make_sure_this_returns_true_otherwise_existence_will_be_erased()</code> with <code>true</code> should keep the tests passing. Rather, it's an invitation to review potential sources of error and look at your implementation with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>Remember, the developer who wrote the code is usually the one also writing the tests. That means absolutely nothing is stopping them from having a blind spot and making the same mistake twice.</p>
<h1 id="between-sky-and-sea">Between Sky And Sea</h1>
<p>There is this notion in the technology world that user interface designers are the tip of the iceberg - and the part of development the uninitiated are most acquainted with - while the Atlantean civilization beyond mortal understanding at the bottom of the sea (also known as &quot;kernel and compiler developers&quot;) stays hidden from view.</p>
<p>There is another world, one which seems to grow year after year. The network architects, the database connectors, the cloud computing specialists - the ones who recite eldritch formulas like &quot;Mongo&quot;, &quot;Postgres&quot; or &quot;Kubernetes&quot; and cast the Summon Money spell. (Unfortunately, Summon Greater Money requires making a pact with an archfiend, such as Microgle or Goosoft).</p>
<p>Two of the talks I attended today were about the connection between a massive database and a user-facing customer application:</p>
<ul>
<li>A MongoDB driver to asynchronously carry data from client to server</li>
<li>A web interactive map that tracks public transit, called <a href="https://maps.catenarymaps.org/">Catenary</a> and which needs to communicate with city APIs that potentially all use conflicting data formats</li>
</ul>
<p>I was quite awed by what I witnessed. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interestingly, while most talks were &quot;here is how you can use this Rust tool/feature in your own project&quot;, these two stood out from the lot by being &quot;here is this cool thing we built using Rust&quot;. Because the audience of RustConf was composed of Rust developers (I hope), I imagine presenting a project like this would require fighting a little harder to keep the audience's interest.</li>
<li>The talks had a &quot;walk me through your call stack&quot; feel, especially the MongoDB one. This is a really deep dive - and therefore technically interesting to anyone with specialized experience wishing to do something like this on their own. But, for those more familiar with different realms of computing, I felt a bit like constantly journeying deeper in a thick forest, and asking &quot;Where did I come from&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<p>A word of appreciation to the Catenary panelist for having bilingual (English/French) slides in his presentation - I felt honoured by this nod to the culture of my home city (Montréal).</p>
<h1 id="interlude">Interlude</h1>
<p>Dear people who code during a coding conference: please show mercy. Please indicate which sacrifices are required to satiate your eldritch thirst. Your zeal is beyond human comprehension.</p>
<h1 id="all-that-work-because-i-m-too-lazy-to-press-one-key">All That Work Because I'm Too Lazy To Press One Key</h1>
<p>I truly got to appreciate <code>rustfmt</code> last summer when contributing to the Rust central repository for my <a href="https://oneirical.github.io/gsocfinal/">Makefile rewrite project</a>. The CI job known as <code>tidy</code> isn't too enthusiastic about my lines of code spanning the entire circumference of Earth in their length.</p>
<p>Today, I got to witness just how many cogs start turning when I mindlessly type &quot;:w&quot; (yes, not Ctrl-S, I know, I'm so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">1337</a>) and see all the little words satisfyingly snap into place.
First, the talk mentioned that mere strings are not sufficient to direct proper formatting. <code>rustfmt</code> needs to generate its own IR (intermediate representation) - a concept normally reserved to compilers - and have a rough understanding of the code's logic to then output back a fully formatted string sequence corresponding exactly to the parsed, messy string.</p>
<p>There is zero room for error - a formatter changing the way code is interpreted by the compiler, even in an extremely subtle way, would be a sad way to crash the latest Blazingly Fast™ NASA satellite written by an excited Rustacean intern.</p>
<p>Because of this parity requirement, some dilemmas arise:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">struct </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">Otter </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">eyes</span><span>: Vec&lt;Eye&gt;,
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">tail</span><span>: Tail, </span><span style="color:#888888;">// Don&#39;t worry, the Tail field can be removed later.
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">cute</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">bool</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's say that this comment is too long and must be moved to the line under or above. But how can you choose? The formatter doesn't understand English. (<a href="https://plang.is/">Unless your compiler is simultaneously a chatbot</a> - opinions on the genius and/or lunacy of such a technology will not be the subject of this post). Compilers don't have to take comments into account, formatters do.</p>
<p>Next, there are macros. They appear in their non-extended state to the formatter, while the compiler sees them in their fully unrolled state. With this mismatch, formatting in such a way that won't cause a difference in the way the compiler parses your code is another challenge.</p>
<p>I really appreciated this talk. It shed light on how complex some of the quality-of-life tools we use can be.</p>
<h1 id="interlude-1">Interlude</h1>
<p>Yes. Let's have two conference rooms. One larger than the Sun with hundreds of chairs, and the other requiring a microscope to properly see. And let's put all the more technical panels in the small room. It will fill right up in milliseconds and the nerds will be sent to listen to the other talk.</p>
<p>Hmph. Sorry. Venting over.</p>
<h1 id="merge-and-release-on-stage">Merge And Release, On Stage</h1>
<p>I used to think there was an inverse correlation between technical skill and the ability to teach it. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09/ars-longa-vita-brevis/">All seconds spent learning how to teach are spent not learning the material, are they not?</a></p>
<p>After the presentation on <code>rkyv</code>, I acknowledge there may be exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>First, I must admit it took me an unreasonable amount of time until I realized it's called <code>rkyv</code> because it sounds like &quot;archive&quot; when you pronounce it. Before this revelation came unto me, I constantly mispelled it as &quot;rykv&quot; or &quot;rkvy&quot;.</p>
<p>Now that this is out of the way, I loved this presentation. I simply must honour the charisma in running <code>cargo publish</code> to ship 0.8 to crates.io live on stage, a version that the panelist worked on for the last 2.5 years.</p>
<p><code>rkyv</code> is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. A deserialization crate without the deserialization part. A rawer, more performant version of Serde, if you will. Not that the archives it outputs are human-readable, unlike the latter.</p>
<p>The concept itself is extremely simple at its core. Take data (like a struct), shove it in a <code>[u8]</code> (slice of bytes), and unpack later. This sounds so simple I wondered why it wasn't more widespread, until I was presented how uncanny some of the edge cases can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute pointers like <code>*const</code> cannot be arbitrarily shoved in a slice, as they contain a memory address. Wrap them up nicely in a <code>Box</code>, perhaps? Now, you must deal with machine-specific endianness, because some computers read left-to-right and others right-to-left.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small tangent: grabbing Arabic numbers from the Arabs and not keeping the right-to-left reading direction (specifically for numbers) was a mistake. Let's say I present to you the number 5XXX(an <code>n</code> number of further X digits). What's that? Can't see the last digits? I'm hiding them with the palm of my metaphorical hand, tough luck. With big-endian (left-to-right), all you know is that it starts with 5, but you're not even sure if that's a 5000 or a 500 000. With little-endian (right-to-left), you know that the number <em>ends with 5</em> and is therefore divisible by 5. More data collected per digit!</p>
<p>Anyhow. The live-published on stage version, 0.8, fixes this irregularity by enforcing endianness and wrapping of absolute pointers automatically. Go try it in your projects! Perhaps you'll be happy with the performance gains.</p>
<p>I loved the final optimistic note of this talk. The developer promised to release in one year... back in 2022. Then, he was reminded of the often forgotten truth in software development that &quot;80% done is actually 20% done&quot; and got stuck for a while.</p>
<p>But. During all that time, <code>rkyv</code> stayed. It didn't regress, it didn't rot. It just waited for the right time. And that time came, today.</p>
<p>That makes me feel a lot better about my own <del>abandoned</del> on-hiatus projects.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>It's not over. I'll be back tomorrow for more fun, more networking, more crab pinching with the hand to fire up the audience. I'll be giving a small &quot;community talk&quot; about my <a href="https://oneirical.github.io/gsocfinal/">Rustc test suite rewrite project</a> at 14:45 (2:45 PM) in the tiny room connected to the main ballroom. I'd be delighted to see familiar (or new!) faces.</p>
<p>This has been an amazing day.</p>

<p>Let's say, theoretically, that you are some average every day nerd who wants to git gud and do a cool techy thing for once. Unfortunately, you have been locked into various educational institutions since the age of 5 and have been constantly at the centre of shallow praise, leading you to believe you do not need to work hard to succeed in life. Now, painfully mediocre compared to the legends writing operating systems in the womb, how will you accomplish this feat?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is relentless violence.</p>
<p>Before me stood 352 Makefiles, used for various compiler integrity and correctness checks in the master Rust repository. Note the past tense - each day of the summer of 2024, I have hacked away at them without pause, rewriting them in Rust with the use of the <code>run-make-support</code> crate - which also needed multiple extensions to emulate the various features present in the Makefile swarm.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one such rewrite:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#888888;"># needs-profiler-support
</span><span style="color:#888888;"># ignore-cross-compile
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">include </span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">../tools.mk
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">COMPILE_FLAGS</span><span>=</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">-g -Cprofile-generate=&quot;</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(TMPDIR)</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#fad07a;">all</span><span>:
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(RUSTC) $(COMPILE_FLAGS) test.rs
</span><span>	$(call </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">RUN</span><span>,test) || exit 1
</span><span>	[ </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">-e </span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(TMPDIR)</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>/default_*.profraw ] || (echo </span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">No .profraw file</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>; exit 1)
</span></code></pre>
<p>which becomes:</p>
<pre data-lang="rs" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-rs "><code class="language-rs" data-lang="rs"><span style="color:#888888;">// -C profile-generate, when used with rustc, is supposed to output

</span><span style="color:#888888;">//@ needs-profiler-support
</span><span style="color:#888888;">//@ ignore-cross-compile
</span><span>
</span><span>use run_make_support::{cwd, has_extension, has_prefix, run, rustc, shallow_find_files};

</span><span>    assert!(!profraw_files.is_empty(), </span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">no .profraw file generated</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>);
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>All progress was neatly catalogued in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/121876">this issue</a>, acting as a Most Wanted hitlist of sorts for the most resilient of Makefiles. As of writing this, <strong>11/352 Makefiles</strong> remain, which mean the porting efforts are <strong>97% complete</strong>. This project was sponsored as part of the Rust Foundation's first year entry into <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/01/gsoc-2024-selected-projects.html">Google Summer of Code</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the extremely commit-spammy nature of this work, this project has rocketed me to - at the time of writing - position #153 of all time in the <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/all-time/">Rust Contributors Leaderboard</a>. I even soared past my mentor jieyouxu, who is an established maintainer. Anyone with two neurons and a functional synapse in between will understand that this is laughably meaningless, especially considering they made the #1 a bot to remind the monomanic maintainers to touch grass and stop burning themselves out. But, hey, it might deceive some foolish figure of authority one day to give me some respect. </p>
<p>Now that your attention is starting to wane, let me proceed right away to stories of various fun moments throughout this project. I wanted to call this part the &quot;House of Horrors&quot;, though it's more a &quot;House of Curiosities&quot; by now.</p>
<h3 id="what-blasphemy-really-looks-like">What Blasphemy Really Looks Like</h3>
<p>Let's start with a demonstration of how cursed these Makefiles can get:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">ifneq </span><span>(,$(findstring x86,</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(TARGET)</span><span>))
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125165">Source.</a></p>
<p>What do you think this means? &quot;If the string <code>x86</code> is not found in the target name, run this block&quot;? <strong>WRONG!</strong> <code>findstring</code> will return <code>x86</code> if it finds it in TARGET, and an empty string otherwise. This is compared with the first argument of the expression, <code>(,</code> (did you miss it?), which is an empty string. That means &quot;if TARGET contains <code>x86</code>, then empty string is not equal to <code>x86</code> (returned by <code>findstring</code>), then run this block.&quot; It's the OPPOSITE of my first impression.</p>
<p>Yes, this is real Rust repository code, running on every single pull request merge as part of the test suite, and it has been present there for <em>years</em>.</p>
<p>Until I arrived, of course. You may start applauding now.</p>

<p>Some parts of Makefile syntax truly cut a line between the wheat and the chaff, with the measured quality being an obsessive tendency to read between the lines. Observe:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#ffb964;">FLAGS </span><span>:= </span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">-C link-args=-Wl,--no-undefined
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126484">Source</a></p>
<p>No whitespace after the comma? Is the formatter broken? Much the opposite: adding a space here would cause <code>--no-undefined</code> to become an extra argument. The test will then crash and burn. You, acute dear reader, have obviously spotted the other whitespace in this string - the third character. That one, as you have guessed with your unmatched intellect, is completely unnecessary:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#ffb964;">FLAGS </span><span>:= </span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">-Clink-args=-Wl,--no-undefined
</span></code></pre>
<p>Perfectly acceptable.</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#ffb964;">FLAGS </span><span>:= </span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">-C link-args=-Wl, --no-undefined
</span></code></pre>
<p>Cast down a Hell pit to be pinched by crabs for all eternity.</p>
<p>Another fun one:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#888888;"># Check that a primary bundle can be loaded and will be preferentially used
</span><span style="color:#888888;"># where possible.
</span><span style="color:#fad07a;">custom</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">test.rs working.ftl
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(RUSTC) $&lt; -Ztranslate-additional-ftl</span><span>=</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(CURDIR)</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">/working.ftl </span><span style="color:#cf6a4c;">2</span><span>&gt;&amp;</span><span style="color:#cf6a4c;">1 </span><span>| </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(CGREP) </span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">this is a test message</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129011">Source</a></p>
<p>Please divert your attention for now from the glorious intuitiveness of <code>$&lt;</code> (replaced by <code>test.rs</code>, the first dependency) and <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> (prints out errors alongside normal output). There is something much more evil at play. Normally, <code>RUSTC</code> calls that are expected to fail will be written like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span>	</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(RUSTC)</span><span> broken-file.rs &amp;&amp; exit 1 || exit 0
</span></code></pre>
<p>This basically means, &quot;if we run <code>RUSTC</code> and it returns 1 (fail), instead, return 0 (success)&quot;. This pattern is extremely common. However, the <code>RUSTC</code> call shown in the bundle test <em>will</em> fail, but has no indication of this. How does the test pass at all? Because the pipe <code>|</code> throws away any resulting exit codes, completely ignoring whether compilation succeeded or failed.</p>
<p>This time, it's supposed to fail, and the error should contain &quot;this is a test message&quot;, but a rust program composed of simply <code>println!(&quot;this is a test message&quot;)</code> would pass this test just as well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the test rewrite roots out such glaring weaknesses:</p>
<pre data-lang="rs" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-rs "><code class="language-rs" data-lang="rs"><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">fn </span><span style="color:#fad07a;">custom_bundle</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#888888;">// Check that a primary bundle can be loaded and will be preferentially used
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#888888;">// where possible.
</span><span>    rustc()
</span><span>        .arg(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">-Ztranslate-additional-ftl=working.ftl</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>        .input(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">test.rs</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>        .run_fail()
</span><span>        .assert_stderr_contains(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">this is a test message</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>);
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="non-euclidean-symlinks">Non-Euclidean Symlinks</h3>
<p>Here is something much less bad, but that launched me into a Schrödinger's cat-approved adventure due to a misunderstanding:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#ffb964;">  NAME </span><span>:= </span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">$(shell </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(RUSTC) --print</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;"> file-names foo.rs)
</span><span>  mkdir -p </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(TMPDIR)</span><span>/outdir
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(RUSTC)</span><span> foo.rs -o </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(TMPDIR)</span><span>/outdir/</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(NAME)
</span><span>	ln -nsf outdir/</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(NAME) $(TMPDIR)
</span><span style="color:#fad07a;">	RUSTC_LOG=rustc_metadata</span><span>::</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;">loader </span><span style="color:#ffb964;">$(RUSTC)</span><span style="color:#99ad6a;"> bar.rs
</span></code></pre>
<p>The pertinent line is the one starting with <code>ln</code>, which creates a systemic link (basically, a portal leading from one place to another) in the file system. We are creating a symlink from <code>TMPDIR</code> to <code>outdir/libfoo.rlib</code> (NAME is libfoo.rlib), which is itself contained inside TMPDIR. What? This &quot;portal&quot; leads to itself? It's a box containing the box?? A house in which the house is stored???</p>
<p>No, I just forgot that command-line utilities tend to auto-complete the destination, and that the operation is actually creating a symlink from <code>TMPDIR/&lt;any symlink cool name&gt;</code> to <code>outdir/libfoo.rlib</code>.</p>

<p>Porting tests requires opening up a massive amount of pull requests. Pull requests require branches. Branches need to be named. And, so it is said...</p>

<p>None of that &quot;informative naming convention&quot; nonsense. <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/name-your-projects-cutesy-things/">Names should be cute, not descriptive.</a></p>

<p>Many, <em>many</em> tests involved looking at symbols in an object file, and doing something with them, such as checking that a certain one is present. In the Makefiles, this used the <code>nm</code> command-line utility. How to port this over? &quot;I'll just rewrite <code>nm</code> in Rust&quot;, I thought. &quot;it will be so easy.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't. After a few days, I modestly accepted my fate and used <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-readobj.html">llvm-readobj</a> instead.</p>
<p>Much, much later in the summer, a new contributor arrived and wrote a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128147/files">custom object file traversal</a> to help port a Makefile. I clicked on her website, where I discovered ASCII-art cats and links leading to other sites containing pride flags.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you need to let the professionals do the job.</p>

<h3 id="a-glimpse">A Glimpse</h3>
<p>Rewriting 300+ Makefiles is, by all sane metrics, an exercise in tedium. What I did here was repetitive and somewhat detached from the &quot;puzzly&quot; part of programming that most nerds seem to name as the reason why they love what they do. According to everything I know about myself, I should have given up way earlier. I should have said &quot;this sucks&quot; or something like that. But I didn't. I actually liked doing it. I put on some dark ambient music albums, entered a trance state and just did it.</p>
<p>I announced at the beginning of the summer that I had a full time 40 hours/week internship that had unexpectedly sprung up. I completed both it and this open source project simultaneously. How I was able to find the time to fulfill my project and still work full time at a software company without getting burnt out of looking at computer screens will be left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>I was assigned tasks, of course. The main one - avoiding excessive detail - was related to implementing an AI product into their application. The task itself probably has more technological complexity than the Makefiles, even though I have a sneaking suspicion that a sizable portion of people part of a community like Rust are going to be at the very least business-AI-skeptics.</p>
<p>The central point: even though it was more &quot;crunchy&quot; in raw programming terms, I found myself enjoying much more the Google Summer of Code to an extent that's not even comparable. And it's only now that I learn something important:</p>
<p>It's not about the tedium of the task, it's about the context of the task.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone I talked to throughout the summer has been way more knowledgeable than me, and yet I still felt among equals. I wasn't working <em>for</em> them, I was <strong>working</strong> with them. At no point did my heart ache with the paranoia I associate with an authority figure prowling about the creaky floorboards of a cubicle maze.</p>
<p>At my &quot;official&quot; workplace, I saw the masquerade of meetings, the theatrics of project managers. I felt like in a playground where the children are replaced by adults pretending to play with the multicoloured slides and swings, their smiles saccharine and hollow.</p>
<p>So much of our world still seems ordered in masters and servants. But, this summer, I saw a glimpse of something different.</p>
<p>The next time a fellow undergraduate student imagines with glee their future in the forges of FAANG/MAMAA and asks me to reciprocate, I'll answer with respectful doubt instead of shared excitement.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I will be in person at <a href="https://rustconf.com/">Rustconf</a> on September 11-12. I'll be accompanied by <a href="https://github.com/eievui5/">an amazing friend</a> whom I'll be seeing in real life for the first time. My excitement is barely contained.</p>
<p>I went from not knowing Rust at all 1 year ago to having my life rewritten in it. Who could have thought the Rewrite It In Rust evangelists had their dominion extend even to people's lives?</p>
<p>If anyone reading this blog is coming to the conference in person, feel free to let me know!</p>
