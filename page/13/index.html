<ol>
<li>&quot;Axioms&quot; have went through a lot. Starting off as generic &quot;press button and pre-coded effect happens&quot;, they ramped up in complexity to hilarious heights, to the point where it was possible to craft spells such as &quot;when taking a step, across the entire map, teleport every creature in random places, then cast all of their spells in random directions&quot; or other such ridiculous combinations. Not only is this completely OP, it is also very hard to understand, especially for those who have not touched coding a lot. </li>
</ol>
<p>In this new Rust version, I have returned them under a simplified version, with only:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Form, dictating where the effect happens.</li>
<li>A Function, dictating what the effect is.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, &quot;Self-Dash&quot; makes you dash around, but &quot;Beam-Dash&quot; forces a creature hit by the beam to dash, basically acting as a knockback effect. I hope that, with varied Forms and Functions, I can strike a good middlepoint between creativity and simplicity. There is still room for crazy stuff down the line.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The Soul Wheel is back, now with extra crispy animations. It always offers 4 Soul casts of Vile, Ordered, Feral, Saintly or Serene type, each one linked to a Form-Function combo. For example, you can set Saintly to be your dash and Vile to be your attack Axiom. It progressively empties a &quot;draw pile&quot; until it &quot;reshuffles&quot; everything back.</p>
<ul>
<li>Serene Souls are infectious, and if a creature has at least one, when it &quot;reshuffles&quot;, a random soul will be converted to Serene type. This means that casting a lot of Axioms will eventually turn your Wheel completely cyan.</li>
<li>Some Functions can &quot;deal damage&quot; - there is no traditional health in TGFP, but it does steal a number of Souls from the victim, disabling them into a stunned husk once all their Souls have been absorbed.
<ul>
<li>Yes, this means that Serene Souls can spread to creatures which do not have them like a disease. If a room is full of creatures fighting each other and only one has a single Serene Soul, given enough time, all Souls in the room will turn Serene.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to improve the &quot;decision-to-keypress ratio&quot;, as DCSS devs would put it, it refills itself automatically - meaning that the complete list of controls required to play my game is now composed exactly of &quot;WASD1234&quot; (rebindable in the future).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The message log is back, with smooth and graceful scrolling. It supports coloured text with [cyan]tags[/cyan] in old school forum style - a feature that was possibly <em>the</em> most horrendously gory piece of code in my JavaScript version. Glad to see it be much simpler in Rust/Bevy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epsilon the robotic snake is back to some extent. Like every creature currently, it has no AI beyond moving in random directions, but its signature multi-tile slithering is pleasing to watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried to bring the Hypnotic Wells, probably the coolest thing about the JavaScript edition of my game. However, it is much harder to pull off now, because I chose to zoom out the player's view a little bit, resulting in miserably minuscule &quot;previews&quot; of the next level. It probably gets even worse with screen resolutions smaller than 1920x1080. Still, I got it to work, though I might end up dropping them entirely in favour of something else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't understand scaling and resolutions at all. How do people get this stuff right? After frustrating amounts of cyber-butchery, I can only get 1920x1080 and 960x540 to render without ugly artifacts. Meanwhile, it feels as if every single game I ever played clamps nicely to my screen no matter what, while mine is constantly too big or too small if I ask some friends to test it. How do you scale a 16x16 sprite to 24x24?? How does DCSS manage to scale its tiles so nicely no matter what size you give to your browser window???</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>More to come soon, I hope. I have sane and insane ideas bubbling about in equal parts, and I intend to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>Hello. How long has it been? 3 weeks? I've been busy with the student's plight that comes with the end of a semester, but still snuck in some progress once in a while. The features showcased today are therefore the product of stray and scattered hours.</p>
<p>It is time to dial down the dreams and get working on real work that produces real results. I showed my genetic algorithm experiment last time I posted here, but I also did another experiment with peer-to-peer multiplayer with rollback in Rust right afterwards. </p>
<p>Useful for my game? Very likely not. Interesting? Absolutely, I am glad that I understand better how networking technology in multiplayer games works now. </p>
<p>But the time for messing around has come to an end.</p>
<p><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pbc5QyDZJ7Y?">Behold.</a></p>
<p>I have redone my entire basic game logic and UI in Rust and the Bevy engine (it used to be in pure JavaScript with the PIXI.js library). I'm a big fan of the minimap and the sidebars!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance has received unfathomable improvements.</li>
<li>I no longer have to bang my head against the brick wall that is scaling the screen to every possible resolution.</li>
<li>The Entity Component System structure is amazing, I never want to do an object-oriented game ever again.</li>
<li>I just write things and they work. I still have not used the debugger once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI support is quite sad. Don't tell anyone, but the &quot;UI&quot; in my game is actually just more game entities, except they follow the player around as it moves.</li>
<li>I have a feeling implementing mouse support will be a terrible experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the game's design - I have once again drawn out my butcher's knife and have been cutting out the chaff. I've been so obsessed with being creative - to the point where I forgot to be reasonable.</p>
<p>As an example, even <strong>the controls</strong> had been turned into a game mechanic. You literally started with a spell which was composed of the editable blocks &quot;When pressing 'W', on the tile north of the caster, move towards the targeted tile, a turn passes'&quot;. Let's list the problems with that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing the &quot;a turn passes&quot; component causes the player to freeze time forever, which is unfathomably OP</li>
<li>Removing any of the other components basically induces a softlock</li>
<li>Rebinding keys, a fundamental part of game design, was tied with a game mechanic (can't just do it in a quick menu, you need to use controls to rebind the controls)</li>
<li>Quality-of-life like &quot;click on a tile to move towards it&quot; like in most modern roguelikes was simply impossible</li>
</ul>
<p>I am dialing it down, keeping the spirit of &quot;build your own abilities&quot; but in such a way that can coexist with the accessibility standards of modern gaming. I have a rather tight concept - a spin on <em>the oldest ideas I ever had for this game</em>, which I'll talk about when it is actually getting implemented.</p>
