<p>It has been a little harder cranking out code this week, but the forges of creation still blaze with maintained interest.</p>
<h1 id="dastardly-traps">Dastardly Traps</h1>
<p>Some new devious creatures have been added to the world generation pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the Arctic Phobist sits alone at the centre of empty rooms. Their constant dread of hypothermia permeates through surrounding minds, inspiring all to huddle and cuddle around it in search of warmth... Which tends to create dangerous piles of stacked foes, unleashed as soon as the Phobist is deactivated by a misfired ability. Its ability also extends to the player, making escape difficult when one is constantly being reeled in...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>groups of Ecstatic Ribbondancers gather in small and cramped areas, and chaotically bounce all over the place like they are super rubber balls. Getting through these gauntlets without getting trapped requires careful steps... which one may not always afford to take when one is being chased by a horde.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w_4A0JDUIbM?">Demonstration of the latter</a>.</p>
<h1 id="interplanar-travel-for-all">Interplanar Travel for All</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A non-negligible quantity of techno-wizardry has now allowed me to keep loading and simulating creatures even when they are not located on the same Plane (floor) as the player. The technique used, which I like to call the &quot;yellow pages&quot;, keeps an index of all specific creatures which are allowed to take input even if the player is not on the same Plane as them, and simulates their actions in a way that is accurate, but does not nuke the game's performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is huge. I can't wait for the applications this new development will have, from banishing foes into pocket dimensions to programming bots to clear far-away Planes for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new special teleportation Axiom allows one to &quot;astral project&quot; into a pocket dimension from your current position, which may be extremely dire. It reminds me a little bit of DCSS's Okawaru Arena, but with a little more interdimensional flair. I've been thoroughly enjoying the related animation...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/atJRdu511U4">Once again, demonstration. Ignore the minor graphical bug</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently in the process of rekindling Epsilon, the multi-tile snake boss, with some extra new zaniness. A fearsome foe awaits...</p>

(very old)</a>)</em></p>
<p>A much quieter week, but it did not stop me from churning out fresh packages from my inner factory of unhinged ideas. Following up from my removal of all tiles... <strong>I am now removing health, damage and killing once again.</strong></p>
<p>Last time, it didn't work out. But that time was a long while ago. This <em>new</em> design may might it work. In a style similar to HyperRogue, the player loses if all action becomes impossible. It simply works so well with the lore... Transcend beyond feeble matters like blood and pain. Unravelling bodies and calling it victory is so brutish. Only when the Soul of your opponents has been fully subjugated or blazed blank can one truly crown themselves the victor...</p>
<p>There are still many ways to defeat creatures, or to be defeated. There are threats of having the literal programming of your character deleted, of being turned into an exact copy of another creature and beginning to mindlessly hunt down a player that no longer exists, or of simply being stuck in a massive pile of entities preventing all motion.</p>
<p>Alongside this rework comes two new Souls, or spells:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Last Saint offers to you a fragment of their ribbon-adorned vision of domination. Using this active ability causes all adjacent creatures to become clones of yourself with all Souls intact... Which leads to utterly <a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Zf-jI5T0o5Y">insane</a> chain reactions when used multiple times. Honestly, trying to even get to the exit when everyone is you is a puzzle in itself. Not to mention that <em>every single clone causes an extra turn to tick away at each keypress</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Data Breather believes true enlightenment comes by viewing the world through the perspective of all creatures big and small - and their gift allows this in a very literal form. It reminds me a little bit of Caves of Qud's domination, though it is more a <a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6URKqkbZX-U">soul swap than a full takeover</a>. I hope these kinds of abilities will create as much fun as the polymorph mechanics in Nethack and such.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also visible in these clips are a new freshly designed trap: the deactivated pink Apiarists remain on standby, while the red Song of the Watchers in the centre continuously scans all 4 entrance points. Entering the room immediately sends the swarm against the intruder - which may not necessarily be the player! Lure a terrible foe inside to obtain aid, or misstep and have your situation worsen? The possibilities are as numerous as stars in the night sky.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Visual spell effects have returned, with greater performance and customization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was going to make another Soul/spell for the Heart Rended By Bladed Leaves, another spirit of sorts in the game that is supposed to be the manifestation of fear itself. It was doing a good job at flipping the entire screen and causing gravity effects, but there were... complications. It will be back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
