<p>I have hauled myself back from confusion into fanatic creation. And with this state of mind comes insane reworks and reimaginings...</p>
<p>For a quick showcase, <strong><a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/embed/990epP62SbU">here is a video showing off pretty much everything in this post.</a></strong></p>
<h1 id="sparks-of-logic-surge-through-synapses">Sparks of Logic Surge Through Synapses</h1>
<p><em>Yet</em> again, the game's core &quot;Axiom&quot; mechanic has been rebuilt from the ground up. Each Soul now contains a Logic Map, which is basically a little electrical circuit. Current begins at certain nodes when something happens, and travels through the network, causing various effects, until there is nothing left to trigger.</p>
<p>In simple terms, it's basically showing a simplified version of the game's source code to the player and letting them edit it while playing.</p>
<p>The Player's Soul, for example, contains the circuit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger Node: When the &quot;W&quot; key is pressed...</li>
<li>Locate the tile north of the Player...</li>
<li>Move towards it, or break circuit if impossible...</li>
<li>Then transmit to all entities the radio broadcast code &quot;EON&quot;. (This basically means, &quot;a turn has ended&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fairly simple rendition of &quot;when pressing W, go up&quot;, but it's fully malleable. Potential ways to &quot;hack&quot; this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a &quot;Harm&quot; component right after locating a tile, to get the classic roguelike ability to bump-attack.</li>
<li>Remove the &quot;EON&quot; transmitter, to stop time and walk around with infinite turns.</li>
<li>Locate the furthest accessible tile north instead of an adjacent one, replace &quot;move towards&quot; with &quot;teleport to&quot;, and get a rocket-boosted dash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Epsilon the robotic giga-snake is back, now running with this new system. It's a multi-tile enemy with squiggly, slithering fashion. The &quot;Logic Map&quot; is fairly complex - but roughly, every other turn, the head moves in the direction of the player. However, Epsilon also &quot;paints&quot; the floor in red underneath him, which lets the tail segments know where to move to retain the snake formation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger Node: When code &quot;EON&quot; is received...</li>
<li>Flip all adjacent Boolean Gates from true to false or vice versa</li>
<li>Boolean Gate: true - if this value is &quot;false&quot;, interrupt circuit here</li>
<li>Locate the tile on which this entity (Epsilon) stands...</li>
<li>Paint that tile red...</li>
<li>Remove all located tiles from memory...</li>
<li>Locate the player's tile...</li>
<li>Move towards it...</li>
<li>Then transmit to all entities the radio broadcast code &quot;SLITHER1&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential ways to &quot;hack&quot; this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the Boolean Flip, making Epsilon permanently deactivated</li>
<li>Paint a ton of tiles in red with a Soul of your own, to throw off the pathfinding</li>
<li>Replace the target (you, the player) with the &quot;nearest creature&quot; to have Epsilon eat his own tail (the segments are considered to be independent creatures)</li>
<li>...or do that, but also filter out Epsilon himself to make him go rage mode and attack everything that comes near.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/embed/J-1iqbYr7zw">Here is what happens if I replace the &quot;EON&quot; trigger with triggers that respond to directional keys...</a> I become Epsilon!</p>
<h1 id="perfectly-timed-steps">Perfectly Timed Steps</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boring empty doorways have now been replaced by sliding airlocks, as can be seen in the above videos. Pshhhh!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now a hallway of lasers which occasionally generates in Epsilon's domain. Each of these coils has a Logic Map of its own, like any other entity in the game. Roughly, they tick down a certain counter and zap the other coil across the hallway when it reaches zero. A funny way to hack it would be changing the &quot;laser link&quot; to yourself instead of the other coil, <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/embed/NF93UE7s-yg">causing absolute havoc</a>. That's right, every coil on the map is drawing a laser-line between me and itself every time it would fire.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-do-all-this-and-not-just-hardcode-it-like-a-normal-person">Why Do All This And Not Just Hardcode It Like A Normal Person</h1>
<p>My vision has endlessly reshaped itself since I started this project, but now, I am pretty adamant that what I really want is a game that requires you to exploit it to win. I think I'll be giving Epsilon some completely broken logic chain (example: on each turn, heal all surrounding entities - since it's a snake it just means the segments will be healing each other ceaselessly). Then, the player will be tasked to engineer something to counteract the problem making Epsilon invincible - to follow up on this example, just separating the segments would be enough!</p>
<p>To this end, in addition to all the ideas I already presented, they could craft a Soul that knocks segments of the tail out of the way, they could forcefully inject a Soul inside Epsilon that transforms healing into damage...</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I have no idea how this will ever be balanced or if this will even make for an interesting game. I will have to make sure enough &quot;hacks&quot; are available to craft fun tools, but that &quot;I win&quot; combos like:</p>
<ul>
<li>When damaged, heal that amount</li>
<li>On each creature except yourself, damage 9999</li>
</ul>
<p>will be inaccessible until the end game, or be counteracted in a certain way.</p>
<p>No matter what, I'm having fun doing these things and it beats splatting FeCKs in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, so there's that.</p>
