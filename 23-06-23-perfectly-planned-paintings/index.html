<p>More remaking of old features to fit the PIXI.js rendering library, more toiling in the UI mines. Gah! At least I may have something more interesting to look forward to in the near future.</p>
<p>Reddit's future prospects have grown about as large as the attention span of its new target audience, it seems. Things might get heated next week. I'm glad that I am hosting all these posts I make on my git repositories!</p>

<p>The Soul Cage room, where TGFP's core crafting mechanic takes stage, has regained all of its auxiliary UI panels! The player may view all kinds of craftable Praxes in a sidebar catalogue, consult the current state of the Axiom being crafted, and pinpoint the location of all placed patterns.</p>
<p>After an Axiom has been crafted, it may be equipped in a work-in-progress but overhauled inventory screen. On the sidebar, all Praxes inside each Axiom are listed, and can be described on a simple mouseover.</p>
<p><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t_8rdFdpf24">Here is a short video showcasing all of these changes!</a> Many textures still unfortunately use the placeholder white square - making these extremely simple glyphs is oddly time consuming. I can't imagine how much time goes into making 3D models and animations for commercial games... And I feel myself drawn closer to the ASCII gods of yore.</p>
<p>The Soul Cage room has also received a curious panel in the bottom left with a lot of numbers - it is a primitive implementation of my new Influence mechanic, which should be a dynamic way to scale both player power and encounter difficulty together.</p>
<p>I've only just started implementing this latter mechanic - so far, there are 8 different &quot;Influence&quot; pools, which can be incremented by unlocking research nodes and subduing Souls attributed to each Caste. My goal is to make a sort of &quot;point shop&quot; for the game itself, in which Influence will be spent automatically to purchase challenges and enemies relevant to what the player is doing. A self-mutating dungeon, if you will! This is in the experiment stage and will be discussed more next week.</p>
