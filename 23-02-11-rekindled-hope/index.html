<p>I'm late, so I'll keep this short.</p>
<p>So, apparently, it turns out that throwing random stuff into a pile, giving it a good shake and then tasting it is not conducive to good design. Since the start of 2023, I have pretty much butchered an initially fun but simple concept by adding tons upon tons of features that served no further purpose beyond reducing the Fun™ factor:</p>
<ul>
<li>A knockback-based combat system that turned out to be a pain to work with in the game's cramped spaces</li>
<li>Full-blown map generation that accomplished little beyond adding arbitrary down-time and backtracking that serves no purpose</li>
<li>Putting those maps inside a giga-maze-map which has, again, done nothing except purposelessly make any kind of save &amp; load function a living hell to implement</li>
<li>A lore rewrite that caused a lot of previous content to stop making sense, and which made it so adding future content that made sense would be horrendously difficult</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to return to my roots. I spent literal hours trying to get a JSON save &amp; load system to work, but it's simply hopeless. There is simply no way I can fit literal hundreds of thousands of tiles inside a JSON document, where each one also has a cyclic reference to a creature which also has a tile object... Abhorrent. Maybe some code archmage could make this work, but it doesn't matter if the game isn't even fun.</p>
<p>I won't give up, though. I already gave up on projects like this way too many times. I don't want to go back to idle daydreaming.</p>
<p>I have a new plan. A new structure with a narrowed-down scope that should hopefully let a save &amp; load feature happen. Something that just takes what worked in the beginning and allows the player to gain more control over it. I know myself and can expect that I can put this idea into much saner words once I've properly translated it from Onei-Delusions into implementable code, so I will talk about it more next week. I actually thought this through over multiple days, so this hopefully won't be another case of designer-delirium.</p>
<p>I won't throw that trio of unfortunate features in the trash, though. I'll recycle the knockback-combat in some gimmick enemy, I'll keep the map system as a core part of my new strategy, and as for the maze... Well, it can procedurally generate mazes. Surely that can fit somewhere in a roguelike game!</p>
