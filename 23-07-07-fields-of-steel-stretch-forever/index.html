<p>Hiding behind a crevice to escape a passing-by patrol of robots in Cogmind, taking two steps forward and one step backwards to clear the Elven Halls in DCSS... There's a lot to like about sprawling roguelike maps, with their many twists and turns presenting opportunity for crafty adventurers.</p>
<p>So, when I looked at my own game, and considered the loop of &quot;clear square room of all enemies&quot; -&gt; &quot;move to next room&quot; -&gt; &quot;repeat&quot;, I couldn't help but feel something was wasted. Due to the structure of <a href="https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/">the tutorial</a> I initially built my game from, when a room was left, it ceased to exist and entered a state of stasis until the player visited it again. </p>
<p>I couldn't tolerate this any longer.</p>

<p>This has been quite the neuron-frying rework, but TGFP now has <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/embed/X0H_527_edQ">full-floor, interconnected maps</a>! The layout is still based off square rooms linked with each other, but the most important feature is that <strong>entities other than the player can now move wherever they please</strong>.</p>
<p>The implementation proved quite challenging. First, to properly generate a unified map, I randomly generate a 9x9 grid of &quot;walls&quot; and &quot;floors&quot; with no isolated floors, then pave each &quot;floor&quot; with a prefabricated vault, chosen at random among multiple possibilities. Finally, I scrape the data from each &quot;vault&quot; and build a single giga-room (&gt;6000 tiles!) from the extracted data. I was expecting this process to turn my 128 MB VRAM, 8 GB RAM laptop into a miniaturized sun, but everything somehow remained perfectly fluid!</p>
<p>Then, to actually display the giga-map, I thought &quot;let us just render every single tile and move the whole map around when the player moves&quot;. Bad idea. There was the miniaturized sun I was after.</p>
<p>Finally, I settled for a 30x30 grid of &quot;projectors&quot; which dynamically update every turn to reflect all tiles in range 15 of the player. It's just like DCSS - the player always remains at the centre, fully enabling any narcissistic tendencies the user may have!</p>
<p>Following this implementation, I struggled very hard to bring back the zooming animation from last week. Initially, it was skewed and caused an annoying lag spike at the end. I worked 5 hours to fix it, butchered my game completely beyond repair and had to undo all changes. Fun. </p>
<p>In the end, some performance testing revealed that the big memory-hog was the function assigning sprites to every single tile, <em>including the black space between the rooms</em>. All it took to fix the lag was a single line of code in the graphics engine: &quot;if tile is not in play area, return&quot;.</p>

<p>The scope for the coming months is... a little imposing. I have a significant addition I wish to add to the core gameplay loop, and I also want to overhaul the pathfinding algorithms from basic-baby Greedy Manhattan Distance to something a little more appropriate for a 81x81 map. So far, the <em>only</em> things tanking my performance have been graphical issues - the back end has never caused any problems. From what I've read about the nightmare A* &amp; friends can be, I expect this may change soon.</p>
<p>I sometimes regret a little choosing JavaScript to get started (but I think harder languages would have demotivated April 2022 me, even though I would be able to handle them now). I am getting frequently trolled by &quot;undefined&quot; types parasiting my data and coming out 5 minutes later to break everything. But, on the other hand, I am massively benefiting from the lack of compile times (offset a little UI element by 3 pixels and instantly see the difference!).</p>
<p>These next weeks will either be glorious or a train wreck. No in between.</p>
