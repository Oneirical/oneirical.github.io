            <h1 id="it-s-me-the-google-sucker-of-code">It's Me, The Google Sucker Of Code</h1>
<p>While browsing through the Web, I found the <a href="https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community">Rust Discord Server Where The Cool Kids Hang Out</a> and found some pearls in the chat history:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lol which fortunate T-compiler person is willing to mentor the run-make test RiiR GSoC project - Jieyou Xu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You, apparently!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the poor GSoC candidate does not know what evil lies ahead of them - Jieyou Xu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am only beginning to realize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, it's me, the sucker who was roped into this - Oneirical (me)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome <del>sucker</del> esteemed person! - Jubilee</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>i like how we keep discovering new cursedness and WTF moments in test suites - Jieyou Xu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hm, the production of WTFs per minute has just started becoming noticeable. In fact, to find this exact quote, I searched &quot;WTF by:(Jieyou's username)&quot; and found exactly 72 matches, with almost every single one tied to some horribly cursed Bash command hack. The point where I truly scored my foothold in the WTF manufactory economy was likely in this specific moment:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#ffb964;">ifneq</span><span> (,$(</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">findstring</span><span> x86,$(</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">TARGET</span><span>)))
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>findstring returns $(TARGET) (non-empty) if it contains the substring x86 or an empty string otherwise, so checking that findstring does not return an empty string checks that target contains the substring... - Jieyou Xu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I beg your pardon? This is actually a great explanation... once you read it 5 times or so.</p>
<p>This is really making me want to compile some of the biggest WTF moments throughout this project and build a little &quot;run-make House of Horror&quot; to spook and scare Rust enjoyers. I already have an excellent introductory addition, with no doubt more to come. I'm pretty sure I noticed a <code>sleep 1</code> getting changed into a <code>sleep 2</code> somewhere for the sole purpose of securing compatibility with the FreeBSD operating system...</p>
<p>Anyhow, this week was marked with the first line of code committed to the Rust repository during the summer, with more to accompany it:</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125165">pgo-branch-weights</a>, a much scarier test, which contained the cursed <code>ifneq</code> shown above and which will require some further review until it looks mergeable.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125224">external-crate-panic-handle-no-lint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That's a bucketload of pull requests... <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125224#issuecomment-2118340932">which did not go unnoticed</a>. Dialing it down and bundling some tests together should be warranted from now on.</p>
<p>Most of these were quite easy and required adding few helper functions... so I wouldn't get too excited just yet. This project is likely getting extended to some amount of weeks that is bigger than 16.</p>
<h1 id="reading-much-harder-than-writing">Reading, Much Harder Than Writing?</h1>
<p>I used to get a little intimidated when I finished a 10 lines of code pull request, and see that in the meantime, another GSoC contributor (if you're reading this, hello FractalFir :3) was building their own personal virtual cathedral, stained glass masterpieces included.</p>
<p>I am obviously not as experienced as them, but there's something else at play... the <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr">Rust-.NET code generator</a> is practically a solo project, without a code review process, while directly making pull requests to a gigantic established codebase requires not only understanding what has been written by people-who-are-not-you, but also integrating your own work within... ensuring that the aforementioned people-who-are-not-you will be able to make heads and tails of it.</p>
<p>It's the first time I am part of something so massive in the technology field. I've always done solo projects like this where I would dump huge bucketloads of code in my personal repository daily. Going from this to the snail's pace of open source is a true change of paradigm... but one I find so very educational. I already knew &quot;lines of code are not a good metric&quot;, but experiencing directly such a striking example really hardens this truth.</p>
<p>It is amusing to think that the Rust-.NET code generator may eventually become one such open source project, with a code review process and integration in software like Unity... Maybe it's going to be a GSoC organization one day.</p>
<p>Hehe, that's a far-fetched thought. Keep building your cathedral, Fractal, you have something very awesome on your hands.</p>
<p>The <code>run-make</code> test rewrites may not be as glamorous as a Whole New Thing, but we all have our part to play in the ecosystem. Each brick we put down is one step closer to higher quality engineering. I am glad to be part of this community :3</p>
