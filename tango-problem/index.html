            <h1 id="the-tango-problem">The Tango Problem</h1>
<p><em>Personal experiments with genetic algorithms and neuroevolution, in Rust, with the Bevy engine.</em></p>
<p>A number of &quot;Psychics&quot; are placed inside a 45x45 play area, and submitted to one of the following two challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get as close as possible to a &quot;Beacon of Light&quot; randomly placed in the space before the 100 turn limit is elapsed. Walls are disabled in this experiment.</li>
<li>Paint as many walls in pink as possible within the space before the 100 turn limit is elapsed. Walls are enabled in this experiment.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Psychics do not &quot;know&quot; these objectives. All they are given is a series of inputs representing their senses, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The angle between themselves and the Beacon of Light</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The North-West-East-South direction in which the Beacon of Light is located</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which adjacent tiles are solid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which tiles in range 2 of themselves are solid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which adjacent tiles are painted walls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which adjacent tiles are unpainted walls</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A neural network receives these inputs as a vector of floating-point numbers (for example, &quot;the Beacon is North of you&quot; could look like [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], &quot;the Beacon is East of you&quot; would be [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]).</p>
<p>Then, snazzy things happen inside one or more hidden layer(s), and a vector of floating-point numbers comes out (such as [0.32, 0.55, 0.38, 0.85, 0.11]). These correspond to actions, such as [Move North, Move West, Move East, Move South, Paint Nearby Walls]. The highest number is the chosen action.</p>
<p>After each 100-turn sequence, each Psychic has their fitness calculated - how well they performed. Initially, this was only based on the objective, such as &quot;the number of tiles separating a Psychic from the Beacon&quot; or &quot;the number of tiles painted.&quot; The best Psychics are selected through &quot;roulette pick&quot; (everyone has a chance to be chosen, that chance increases with the fitness score), some mutations are applied to the neural network's weights, and a new generation is born, which will hopefully fare better than the last.</p>
<p>But, this proved insufficient. I first observed the &quot;Tango Problem&quot; in the Beacon experiment - large numbers of Psychics would simply move down until they were on the same Y coordinate as the Beacon, <a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hB14TX1fW4w">then simply move up and down over and over</a>.</p>
<p>Why was this happening? After some struggling, I figured it out.</p>
<p>A lucky Psychic would occasionally spawn on the same X level as the Beacon. Then, they &quot;figured out&quot; that they could just move down until the Beacon was reached, and start moving up and down over and over again. This was gloriously rewarded by the system - after all, they perfectly completed the task of reaching the Beacon and staying on it!</p>
<p>Other Psychics would start copying this behaviour - except these are not actually on the same X level of the Beacon, and as such would fail the test, forming a line passing through the Beacon across the entire level. Naturally, there would always be at least one lucky Psychic succeeding through this strategy and making this behaviour repeat itself.</p>
<p>My answer was to add, in the fitness function, a HUGE reward for Psychics who would dare to use more than just 2 different actions. This immediately solved the issue, as the &quot;bob up and down and hope to be lucky&quot; strategy could no longer result in the maximum possible fitness a Psychic could reach. <a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DCK_dFT3g3Q">Here is the result!</a></p>
<p>The painting experiment followed. It, too, experienced struggled related to the Tango Problem (which, I believe, is known as &quot;getting stuck in a local maximum&quot; in the literature): some Psychics would occasionally be very lucky and spawn next to many walls, which means they can just stay there, paint their surroundings, never move and still score 3-7 points without effort. Psychics that actually see an unpainted wall, move towards it and paint it are not rewarded as well.</p>
<p>Once again, I added extra objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not stay in the same place for too long. (this resulted in Psychics bobbing up and down just like in the original Tango Problem and not doing anything else)</li>
<li>Receive a penalty for re-painting already painted walls (this resulted in Psychics being terrified of ever painting anything)</li>
<li>Receive a bonus for moving far away from the spawn location (this result in Psychics all rushing the bottom of the screen and painting it, leaving the rest of the level unpainted)</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant tweaking may eventually produce even more performant results, but for now, a balance of all these objectives does succeed in achieving a <a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UDU3e50UbQo">&quot;trickle down&quot; strategy where all Psychics move towards the bottom of the screen, painting walls as they fall down.</a> (Creatures being in walls at the bottom is purely a visual glitch - I am not quite sure how to handle getting just the right amount of Bevy entities in each simulation without causing major performance issues).</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, I am happy with how much I have learned from this mini-project. Studying genetic algorithms initially made it seem like they could handle anything with brute force and sufficient time, but I see now that the objectives, &quot;sense&quot; inputs and possible action outputs change everything. It is very easy for these algorithms to find something judged to be &quot;good enough&quot; and stick to it without much of an attempt to improve or innovate. I am aware a good algorithm should balance between exploitation and exploration, but the amount of tweaking required to reach this fine balance is truly a work of absolute precision and patience.</p>
<p>Rust is an interesting piece of technology. Its &quot;fearless concurrency&quot; was very useful in making this program able to BOTH display the results of a completed simulation and train more simulations in the background <strong>at the same time</strong>. As someone coming from dynamic, untyped languages like JavaScript and Python, it is truly astounding how many errors are prevented just through rust-analyzer's watchful eye. I am however disappointed by the constant long recompilation times at each added library, the rather poor step-by-step debugging support, and how rust-analyzer loves turning my CPU into a localized micro-sun.</p>
