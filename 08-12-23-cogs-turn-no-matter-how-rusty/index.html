<p>Hello. How long has it been? 3 weeks? I've been busy with the student's plight that comes with the end of a semester, but still snuck in some progress once in a while. The features showcased today are therefore the product of stray and scattered hours.</p>
<p>It is time to dial down the dreams and get working on real work that produces real results. I showed my genetic algorithm experiment last time I posted here, but I also did another experiment with peer-to-peer multiplayer with rollback in Rust right afterwards. </p>
<p>Useful for my game? Very likely not. Interesting? Absolutely, I am glad that I understand better how networking technology in multiplayer games works now. </p>
<p>But the time for messing around has come to an end.</p>
<p><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pbc5QyDZJ7Y?">Behold.</a></p>
<p>I have redone my entire basic game logic and UI in Rust and the Bevy engine (it used to be in pure JavaScript with the PIXI.js library). I'm a big fan of the minimap and the sidebars!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance has received unfathomable improvements.</li>
<li>I no longer have to bang my head against the brick wall that is scaling the screen to every possible resolution.</li>
<li>The Entity Component System structure is amazing, I never want to do an object-oriented game ever again.</li>
<li>I just write things and they work. I still have not used the debugger once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI support is quite sad. Don't tell anyone, but the &quot;UI&quot; in my game is actually just more game entities, except they follow the player around as it moves.</li>
<li>I have a feeling implementing mouse support will be a terrible experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the game's design - I have once again drawn out my butcher's knife and have been cutting out the chaff. I've been so obsessed with being creative - to the point where I forgot to be reasonable.</p>
<p>As an example, even <strong>the controls</strong> had been turned into a game mechanic. You literally started with a spell which was composed of the editable blocks &quot;When pressing 'W', on the tile north of the caster, move towards the targeted tile, a turn passes'&quot;. Let's list the problems with that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing the &quot;a turn passes&quot; component causes the player to freeze time forever, which is unfathomably OP</li>
<li>Removing any of the other components basically induces a softlock</li>
<li>Rebinding keys, a fundamental part of game design, was tied with a game mechanic (can't just do it in a quick menu, you need to use controls to rebind the controls)</li>
<li>Quality-of-life like &quot;click on a tile to move towards it&quot; like in most modern roguelikes was simply impossible</li>
</ul>
<p>I am dialing it down, keeping the spirit of &quot;build your own abilities&quot; but in such a way that can coexist with the accessibility standards of modern gaming. I have a rather tight concept - a spin on <em>the oldest ideas I ever had for this game</em>, which I'll talk about when it is actually getting implemented.</p>
