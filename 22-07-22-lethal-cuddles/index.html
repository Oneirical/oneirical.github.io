            <p>After almost letting this project go, I clung to my willpower, and got back into the fray. I know I have a very volatile personality when it comes to discipline, but &quot;anchoring&quot; my project by talking about it routinely to friends, and even posting here, really helps keep this game in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>The Games Foxes Play</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Oneirical/The-Games-Foxes-Play">github</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/uzb3iu/sharing_saturday_416/iaa1w3u/">original post</a> | <a href="https://oneirical.itch.io/tgfp">play online on itch.io</a>)</p>
<p>Yes, the hallmark of this week was getting a very early alpha playable online in browser! The game may be very nascent, but already has a lot of depth to it. My composer friend has been playing non stop (I do not deserve him) and finding a terrarium-full of ridiculously obscure bugs, that I have now fixed.</p>
<p>Seriously, how does he do it? I'm terrified that he found out you could duplicate a certain Soul if you casted it, then kited a Serene Peacekeeper into a Soul Shard trap, then killed the Peacekeeper, and then waited for the resulting Crawling Husk to kill the Felidol that had just spawned. What brought him to do such a complex and unnecessary procedure is beyond my understanding.</p>
<p>As for proper new content, there is a new Modulator, the Fluffian Hover-Field. It grants immunity to floor hazards, and allows for flight in vertical levels with gravity. Really useful against goop-trailing enemies of various kinds!</p>
<p>There is a new enemy, the Messenger of Aculeo. Watch out for its constricting, rib-crushing hugs!</p>
<p>Additionally, all modulators (except one) will now grant a special passive ability to all Serene-type allies and summons. An Alacrity module will grant haste, a Selective Algorithm will grant an infectious touch that turns damaged enemies into more Serene-type allies, a pair of Thrusters will let Serene-types perform an additional dash attack, and the aforementioned Hover-Field will occasionally let Serene-types place down Harmony traps. These traps will convert any unfortunate foe stepping on it into another Serene-type ally.</p>
<p>This means that once a few modulators have been acquired, the player is encouraged to start off fights with the conversion/recruitment ones, and then swap to the more offensive ones when a good snowball of Serene-types has been acquired. I want a Serene-type strategy to be one of the possible &quot;builds&quot; that can win the game - it would resemble necromancy magic in other roguelikes.</p>
<p>I've made it so every game starts with a random modulator. I am not sure if some are really objectively stronger than others - yes, Alacrity is very good if you are going full blaster and fireworks, but the more subtle ones can really shine when a lot of allies are placed on the board. There's currently a few overpowered synergies and recipes here and there. I'm not quite sure if I will be nerfing them, or letting them in just because they are fun and hard to achieve anyways.</p>
<p>I haven't won my own game yet... My best so far was area 12. EDIT: 13 now! My friend is obsessed and has played it for hours, and died in area 17, which is in fact the very last level. I have a feeling it might get a little bit easier as I continue adding more player options - I think it's better for a designer to move from too hard towards good than too easy towards good.</p>
