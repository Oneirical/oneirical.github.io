<p>All this mind-numbing UI work was starting to take its toll. Last weekend, I was feeling so, <em>so</em> burnt out from all those pesky dancing pixels all over my screen trolling me and refusing to know their place. </p>
<p>I even played some Cogmind for, ahem, game development research purposes, yes. I got to Access-1 for the first time! (and promptly got clapped). Above all, I couldn't stop being amazed at all the little touches to make the UI feel more computer-like - all of that must have taken months.</p>
<h1 id="reassemble-the-foundations-of-truth">Reassemble the Foundations of Truth</h1>
<p>Something very ironic about my <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504088568084561930/1119416024106795098/rWBIjpR.png">&quot;research web&quot;</a> is how much it helps me develop my game. Every time I am wondering what to work on next, I just play my game filling it out until I hit a void of incomplete content preventing me from progressing in it. Then, I fill in the gap with Content™ and proceed to the next node. It really makes me feel like I am learning the arts of soul-weaving alongside my protagonist.</p>
<p>This time, the aforementioned gap required me to redirect my current focus towards a more fun part of programming than UI design: awesome spells. First things first, all of the 6 starter spells offered to the player were still running on the old system - just a big block of code working through arbitrary effects. This is simply unacceptable: I <em>must</em> show new players a glimpse of all the reality-shattering incantations they might be able to build with some creativity.</p>
<p>I removed all of that chaff. For context, my game revolves around crafting spells out of components like &quot;select all targets near walls&quot;, &quot;on all targets, apply a status effect&quot; or &quot;when a step is taken, automatically cast this spell&quot;. I expected to just slap together some of the components I had already made to give 6 examples of cool combos and call it a day.</p>
<p>Of course, I ended up remaking a huge chunk of my magic system in the process. It was simply inevitable. Such is the Onei way.</p>
<p>Before, the 4 categories of spell components (Contingencies, Forms, Mutators and Functions) were tangled in a whole package of obscure, arbitrary and hard-coded rules. To make this system even more <del>chaotic</del> flexible, I have completely done away with all these weird requirements. Each spell is now just an ordered list of components!</p>
<p>If I make &quot;EGO, CLICK, EGO, PLUSCROSS, HARM&quot;, it will always have the same effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>EGO: Select the tile you are standing on.</li>
<li>CLICK: Set down a trap on all selected tiles (in this case, just one). Push all following components in that trap's mechanism, then stop the spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the spell just plops down a trap under your feet with &quot;EGO, PLUSCROSS, HARM&quot; on it, and that's it. But what happens when something actually steps on it?</p>
<ul>
<li>EGO: Select the trap tile.</li>
<li>PLUSCROSS: Also select all tiles in a cross formation, like firing a laser beam in all 4 cardinal directions.</li>
<li>HARM: Deal damage to all entities in selected tiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, not only does the trap damage the one who steps on it, it also explodes and deals significant collateral damage! </p>
<p>What I just described is the Artistic starter spell (or &quot;Axiom&quot;, as they are called in game). I have made 5 others, all with their own themed sequences. Let me show you the Feral one:</p>
<p><em>deep breath</em> - &quot;EGO&quot;, &quot;TRAIL&quot;, &quot;BLINK&quot;, &quot;SPREAD&quot;, &quot;IGNORECASTER&quot;, &quot;HARM&quot;.</p>
<p>Let's work this through step by step. </p>
<ul>
<li>EGO: Select the tile you are standing on.</li>
<li>TRAIL: From now on, all entities on selected tiles will leave behind a &quot;trail&quot; that selects tiles as they move.</li>
<li>BLINK: On all selected tiles (in this case, just you), the entity there dashes in the direction of its last move.</li>
<li>The player dashes, and TRAIL is triggered, selecting all tiles they pass through.</li>
<li>SPREAD: All selected tiles spread out to all adjacent tiles, selecting them as well.</li>
<li>IGNORECASTER: From now on, the caster of this Axiom will not be affected by any effects of this Axiom.</li>
<li>HARM: All entities on selected tiles take damage (except the caster, due to IGNORECASTER).</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, dash, then strike all creatures near the dash!</p>
<p>Here's how <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/embed/M-IFFOaRxxo">both of these spells look</a> in game!</p>
<p>There are now 30 different Axiom components (named &quot;Praxes&quot; in game) available for mix-and-matching, with many more already designed and coming along. So many exciting contraptions await...! I've already started reworking the spell crafting room with a whole new algorithm, but that is unfinished and will be featured in next week's post.</p>
<h1 id="thick-smoke-shrouds-understanding">Thick Smoke Shrouds Understanding</h1>
<p>I'm aware that all of this is pretty dense. I don't expect everyone to enjoy this type of gameplay, but I personally like it and I am making this game for myself first and foremost. However, I do understand that 3 trillion Axioms constantly firing over the place could become a clarity problem. The enemies have them too, after all.</p>
<p>I've noticed that many roguelikes operate with an &quot;animation queue&quot; - on your screen, you see the player fire their spell, then the spell travelling across the screen, then things exploding, then very unpleased archers firing back a volley at the player. In TGFP, right now, everything happens simultaneously, which does not aid comprehension in the slightest. </p>
<p>However, Rift Wizard has an animation queue and its turns can last upwards of 15 seconds just because of it. I always played it on &quot;XtraSpeed&quot; mode where everything was instant.</p>
<p>For a compromise, I think I might add an option like this in my game, but also make it so entering a keypress while the animations are executing would instantly skip them and proceed to the next turn. I would show the tiles getting selected one-by-one by each component, then the effects occuring, and so on...</p>
<p>Well. Later. I don't want to touch the front-end code for a little while. In a perfect world, my game would be beamed directly into the player's consciousness without petty needs for &quot;graphics&quot; or &quot;interface&quot;, but as I am shackled by my frail corporeal form, I suppose I must make do with making shiny buttons.</p>
<p>What an unfortunate fate.</p>
